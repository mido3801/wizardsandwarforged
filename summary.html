            <p class="session-summary">
                The adventurers arrived at Strixhaven, eager to begin their studies.
                They learned that they would be competing with a similar group of five other wizards for the privilege of participating in a mission for the Draconic Council.
                After being unfortunately trounced in a quick competition with their rivals they made their way through the first week of classes very successfully.

            <p class="session-summary">
                The party continues their scholastic journey, with two new events on their calendar. The first was the Echoic Exigesis, an event where the Oracle
                shares the magical echoes of a past alumni in a grand spectacle. However in a surprising turn of events it was Cephus who was called up to have his read.
                He fled shortly after, only for the party to gather and decide to try to break into Hunjar's office. However due to some unfortunate luck they were caught
                red-handed.

                A few weeks later the party found themselves rocketed away to Sharn for what they were told was a very time-limited adventure in the Cogs to investigate
                a supposed Dhakaani ruin. After splitting up, half of the party found themselves face-to-face with a Medusa, handling it incredibly deftly and impressing even
                their seemingly standoffish chaperone.

            <p class="session-summary">
                Having climbed their way out of the Dhakaani ruin beaneath Sharn, they are given the opportunity to spend a little more time in the city, which the party
                uses to attempt to investigate the recent disappearances in the Cogs. After returning to the University the party meets with Hunjar, explaining that their chaperone
                confiscated an artifact that was found in the ruins.

                The party then splits up for the week, each of them investigating/taking part in their own activities for the week, part of which include preparing for the 
                gutter-wine drinking contest that is somehow being organized as an official contest between the two parties.
