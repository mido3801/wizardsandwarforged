      <h1>Wizards and Warforged</h1>
      
      <p class="introduction">Hidden away within the mountains of Argonnessen, where the arcane energies pulsate with life, lies the iconic Wyrmsworn Academy. Built 300 years ago by the grandeur and foresight of the mighty dragons, this institution was conceived as a beacon of enlightenment, drawing magic wielders from every corner of the world. Strixhaven was more than just a place of learning; it was a symbol of unity and progress, a testament to what the races of Eberron could achieve when magic became the bond that ties.</p>

      <p class="conflict">But times have changed. The very essence of Strixhaven has been tested. The scars of the Last War, a conflict that ravaged the lands and souls of Eberron, have left a deep imprint on the university. Where once the halls echoed with the laughter of students from diverse backgrounds, now there is a palpable tension. The alliances formed within these walls are fragile, and the threat of dissolution looms large.</p>

      <p class="turning-point">In a surprising turn of events, it was announced that the newest class of admitted spellcasters would be constrained only to wizards, and that these would be the last admissions for the forseeable future. The world is alight with rumors about why this decision was made, and it has been a mad dash for young wizards the world over to attempt to garner admission.</p>

      <p class="players-role">As a new class of wizards, you stand on the precipice of a world that's on the cusp of transformation. Your journey at the Academy will be unlike any other. The choices you make, the alliances you form, and the magic you wield will not only shape your destiny but also the fate of Wyrmsworn and, perhaps, all of Eberron.</p>

      <p class="closing-statement">Prepare yourselves, for the challenges ahead are formidable. But remember, in the hallowed halls of Wyrmsworn Academy, magic isn't just a tool; it's a way of life. Will you rise to the occasion and solidify the legacy of this institution, or will you be a witness to its final chapter?</p>
